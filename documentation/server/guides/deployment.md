title: Deploying to Servers or Public Cloud
---

The following guides can help with the packaging and deployment of a server-side Swift application to private servers or public cloud providers.

## Packaging

<ul class="grid-level-0">
    <li class="grid-level-1">
        <h3>Docker</h3>
        <p>This guide explains how to use Docker to build and run a server-side Swift application on your local machine. It demonstrates how to create Docker images and use Docker Compose to host the required infrastructure locally, including a PostgreSQL database service with a TLS connection.</p>

    </li>
    <li class="grid-level-1">
        <h3>Static Linux SDK</h3>
        <p>The Swift Static Linux SDK allows you to build your program as a fully statically linked executable, with no external dependencies at all (not even the C library), which means that it will run on any Linux distribution as the only thing it depends on is the Linux system call interface.</p>

        <h3>Deploying to Fargate using Vapor & MongoDB</h3>
        <p>This guide illustrates how to deploy a Server-Side Swift workload on AWS. The workload is a REST API for tracking a To Do List. It uses the Vapor framework to program the API methods. The methods store and retrieve data in a MongoDB Atlas cloud database. The Vapor application is containerized and deployed to AWS on AWS Fargate using the AWS Copilot toolkit.</p>

If you are deploying to your own servers (e.g. bare metal, VMs or Docker) there are several strategies for packaging Swift applications for deployment, see the packaging guides section for more information.
